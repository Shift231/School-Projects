Notable school project/assignments
This project introduced us to the use of Ajax and Json.
This website is composed of 2 pages. One page is responsible for creating new items and saving them to the database
the other is displaying the items by using ajax calls and reading json data. The display website automaticaly
updates every 5 seconds without refreshing.
